The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reports that, as of preliminary reports through
June of 2023, traffic accidents involving fatalities, in aggregate, are down about 3\%. This decrease is positive,
but looking only at changes from year to year hides the true scale of the problem for vulnerable non-vehicle
road users. While the overall change for pedestrians is also 3\%, the baseline level of risk for pedestrians is
much higher than for passenger vehicles or even for pedalcyclists. Among accidents involving pedestrians, the fatality
range anywhere from a 14\% to 23\% baseline fatality rate throughout the year, depending on the month in
question \cite{national_highway_traffic_safety_administration_early_2024}.
