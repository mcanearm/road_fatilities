	abstract = {OBJECTIVES. Proposed increases in corporate average fuel economy standards would probably lead to lighter cars. Well-established relationships between occupant risk and car mass predict consequent additional casualties. However, if size, not mass, is the causative factor in these relationships, then decreasing car mass need not increase risk. This study examines whether mass or size is the causative factor. METHODS. Data from the Fatal Accident Reporting System are used to explore relationships between car mass, car size (as represented by wheelbase), and driver fatality risk in two-car crashes. RESULTS. When cars of identical (or similar) wheelbase but different mass crash into each other, driver fatality risk depends strongly on mass; the relationship is quantitatively similar to that found in studies that ignore wheelbase. On the other hand, when cars of similar mass but different wheelbase crash into each other, the data reveal no dependence of driver fatality risk on wheelbase. CONCLUSIONS. Mass is the dominant causative factor in relationships between driver risk and car size in two-car crashes, with size, as such, playing at most a secondary role. Reducing car mass increases occupant risk.},

	abstract = {Since the 1970s, the United States has strengthened fuel economy standards in order to reduce oil consumption and emissions from light-duty vehicles. However, there has been a dramatic market shift away from cars and towards light trucks, particularly sport utility vehicles, during this same period. This study quantifies the total impact of the rise of light trucks from model years 2000-2017. These additional light trucks will produce 867-3,519 million short tons of greenhouse gases across their lifetimes, compared to three alternative scenarios. These emissions are enough to offset 19-75\% of the projected savings from the model year 2011-2025 CAFE standards. The combined cost of these emissions and the increased risk of traffic fatalities light trucks pose may reach \$94.3-350.7 billion. These costs indicate the need for the federal and state governments to update transportation policies, including amending fuel economy standards, raising fuel taxes, and regulating vehicles based on weight.},

	abstract = {Pedestrian deaths in the US have risen in recent years. Concurrently, US vehicles have increased in size, which may pose a safety risk for pedestrians. In particular, the increased height of vehicle front-ends may present a danger for pedestrians in a crash, as the point of vehicle contact is more likely to occur at the pedestrian’s chest or head. I merge US crash data with a public data set on vehicle dimensions to test for the impact of vehicle height on the likelihood that a struck pedestrian dies. After controlling for crash characteristics, I estimate a 10 cm increase in the vehicle’s front-end height is associated with a 22\% increase in fatality risk. I estimate that a cap on front-end vehicle heights of 1.25 m would reduce annual US pedestrian deaths by 509.},
